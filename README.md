The wiki is available [here](https://github.com/redmechanic/Minesweeper.NET/wiki).

The goal of this is to make a minesweeper game that gets rid of all the extra garbage that no-one really uses. Clean and simple.

<b>Things this does not include from Windows 7 minesweeper:</b>
 - Question Marks
 - Right click and left click to chord (It is now just right click)
 - Obnoxiously huge cells

<b>Things this adds:</b>
 - Boundless Custom Sizes (Within reason)
 - Solver AI (Generate a game which does not require guessing in near future)

<b>Planned features:</b>
 - Custom puzzles and editor
 - Generation without guessing
 - Win state
 - Mine explosions
 - Sounds
