The wiki is available [here](https://github.com/redmechanic/Minesweeper.NET/wiki).

The goal of this is to make a minesweeper game that gets rid of all the extra garbage that no-one really uses. Clean and simple.

This is known to be blocked by Windows SmartScreen. It is not malicious. Feel free to browse through the source code and compile it yourself if you feel that is necessary. 

<b>Things this does not include from Windows 7 minesweeper:</b>
 - Question Marks
 - Right click and left click to chord (It is now just right click)
 - Obnoxiously huge cells

<b>Things this adds:</b>
 - Custom puzzles and editor
 - Boundless Custom Sizes (Within reason)
 - Solver AI (Generate a game which does not require guessing in near future)

<b>Planned features:</b>
 - Generation without guessing
 - Win state
 - Mine explosions
 - Sounds
