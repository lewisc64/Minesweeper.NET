The wiki is available [here](https://github.com/redmechanic/Minesweeper.NET/wiki).

The goal of this is to make a minesweeper game that gets rid of all the extra garbage that no-one really uses. Clean and simple.

This is known to be blocked by Windows SmartScreen. It is not malicious. Feel free to browse through the source code and compile it yourself if you feel that is necessary (clean the build first of course).

<b>Things this does not include from Windows minesweeper:</b>
 - Question marks
 - Right click and left click to chord (It is now just right click)
 - Annoyingly small cells (Windows XP minesweeper cells were 16x16, In this cells are 20x20)

<b>Things this adds:</b>
 - Custom puzzles and editor
 - Boundless Custom Sizes (Within reason)

<b>Planned features:</b>
 - Generation without guessing (Implemented, not polished as of yet)
 - Sounds (maybe)
